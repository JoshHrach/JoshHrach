### Hi there 👋

I'm Josh. I'm currently an iOS developer at U-Haul. 

I've been programming since 2002, and developing iOS apps since 2013. Much of that time was spent working alone on projects, so I value the importance of getting answers and assistance when needed. I'm always happy to help with Swift/iOS questions.

### Current Projects 👨🏻‍💻

Besides my day job, I build apps under [Random Projects](http://www.random-projects.com). Currently, that includes:

* Countr - A simple digital clicker counter. Take a count of anything and everything, across iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.
* More projects coming real soon
